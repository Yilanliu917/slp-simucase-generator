### **Profile 1: Eli Thompson** (Generated by: gpt-4o)
**Age:** 7 | **Grade:** 1st Grade | **Gender:** Male

#### Background
- **Medical History:** Eli was born full-term with no complications. He experienced frequent ear infections as a toddler and had tubes placed at age 3. No known allergies.
- **Parent Concerns:** Eli's parents are concerned about his difficulty in pronouncing certain sounds, particularly 'r' and 's,' and his occasional stuttering, especially when he is excited or anxious.
- **Teacher Concerns:** Eli's teacher reports that he often hesitates or repeats sounds during class discussions, which sometimes affects his participation. She notes that while Eli is friendly and eager to learn, peers occasionally have trouble understanding him due to his speech clarity.

#### Annual IEP Goals
1. Eli will improve his articulation skills to accurately produce the 'r' and 's' sounds in all positions of words with 80% accuracy in structured activities.
2. Eli will demonstrate improved fluency by reducing instances of stuttering to less than 3% during spontaneous speech in the classroom environment.
3. Eli will increase his self-monitoring skills by identifying moments of disfluency and utilizing learned strategies to improve speech fluency with 70% success in therapy sessions.

#### Latest 3 Session Notes
**Session 1:** Eli participated actively in today's session, showing progress in isolating the 'r' sound in words.
**Session 2:** He successfully used the 'easy onset' strategy to manage his speech rate and reduce stuttering by 50% during reading activities.
**Session 3:** Continued practice with his articulation flashcards at home is recommended to support skill retention.
**Session 4:** Next session will focus on generalizing the 's' sound production in connected speech.

### **Profile 3: Liam Johnson** (Generated by: claude-3-opus)
**Age:** 6 | **Grade:** 1st Grade | **Gender:** Male

#### Background
- **Medical History:** Unremarkable birth history and development. No significant medical concerns.
- **Parent Concerns:** Parents report that Liam has difficulty pronouncing certain sounds correctly, especially 'r' and 'th' sounds. They also note that he occasionally repeats sounds or words when speaking, which seems to be worse when he is excited or nervous.
- **Teacher Concerns:** Liam's teacher reports that his speech is sometimes difficult to understand due to articulation errors. She has also observed some stuttering behaviors, particularly repetitions of sounds and words, which seem to impact his confidence when speaking in class.

#### Annual IEP Goals
1. By the end of the IEP period, given visual and verbal cues, Liam will produce target sounds /r/ and /th/ in words and phrases with 80% accuracy in structured therapy tasks.
2. By the end of the IEP period, Liam will use fluency-enhancing strategies (e.g., easy onset, phrasing) to reduce stuttering moments to less than 5% of syllables during conversational speech in the therapy setting.

#### Latest 3 Session Notes
**Session 1:** Session focused on /r/ production at the word level using minimal pair contrasts and tactile cues. Liam demonstrated 70% accuracy with /r/ in initial position and 60% in medial position. Introduced easy onset strategy for fluency with 50% accuracy.
**Session 2:** Targeted /th/ production in phrases using visual cues and articulation stories. Accuracy improved to 75% at the phrase level. Reviewed easy onset and added phrasing strategy for fluency. Liam self-monitored stuttering moments with 60% accuracy and used strategies with 70% accuracy in structured tasks.
