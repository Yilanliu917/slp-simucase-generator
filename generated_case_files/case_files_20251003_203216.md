### **Profile 1: Ethan James** (Generated by: gpt-4o)
**Age:** 7 | **Grade:** 1st Grade | **Gender:** Male

#### Background
- **Medical History:** Ethan was born full-term with no complications reported during delivery. He has a history of recurrent ear infections in his early preschool years but has not had any in the past year. Ethan has no known allergies and is up-to-date with all vaccinations.
- **Parent Concerns:** Ethan's parents are concerned about his difficulty being understood by peers and family members. They notice that he often struggles to pronounce certain sounds and sometimes stutters when excited or anxious.
- **Teacher Concerns:** Ethan's teacher has observed that he often hesitates and repeats parts of words, especially at the beginning of sentences. She reports that while Ethan is a bright student, his speech difficulties sometimes affect his willingness to participate in class discussions.

#### Annual IEP Goals
1. Ethan will correctly produce the /r/, /s/, and /l/ sounds in all positions of words with 90% accuracy across three consecutive sessions.
2. Ethan will demonstrate smooth speech with less than 2% stuttering-like disfluencies during structured and unstructured conversations, as measured by SLP observation and data collection.
3. Ethan will increase his intelligibility to 80% as perceived by unfamiliar listeners in both spontaneous and structured speech tasks.

#### Latest 3 Session Notes
**Session 1:** Ethan attended his speech therapy session with enthusiasm. During the session, he practiced producing the /r/ sound in isolation and in initial position of words. He achieved 70% accuracy with minimal cues.
**Session 2:** Ethan participated in a fluency activity where he practiced using easy onset and slowed speech rate. He demonstrated decreased tension in speech, with a reduction in stuttering events.
**Session 3:** During a story-telling activity, Ethan was able to retell a familiar story with 75% intelligibility. His articulation errors were noted mostly with /s/ and /l/ sounds.
**Session 4:** Ethan showed progress in using self-correction strategies when a disfluency occurred, but he still requires prompting to implement them independently.
