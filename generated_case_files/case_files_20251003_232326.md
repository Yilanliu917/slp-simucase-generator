### **Profile 1: Alex Johnson** (Generated by: qwen2.5:32b)
**Age:** 6 | **Grade:** 1st Grade | **Gender:** Male

#### Background
- **Medical History:** No known medical conditions or surgeries.
- **Parent Concerns:** Parents have noticed Alex has difficulty pronouncing words clearly, especially with /r/ and /l/ sounds. They are concerned this may affect his academic performance and social interactions.
- **Teacher Concerns:** Teacher reports that Alex often mispronounces words during class activities, which sometimes makes it hard for other students to understand him.

#### Annual IEP Goals
1. Improve articulation skills by accurately producing /r/ and /l/ sounds in single words with 80% accuracy across three consecutive sessions.
2. Increase the ability to use correct pronunciation of /r/ and /l/ sounds in sentences during group activities with 75% accuracy over four weeks.

#### Latest 3 Session Notes
**Session 1:** Session Date: October 12, 2023
**Session 2:** Focus Areas: Targeting production of /r/ and /l/ in isolation and within words.
**Session 3:** Activities Conducted: Used mirror work to demonstrate correct tongue placement for /r/ and /l/. Practiced words like 'red', 'run', 'love', and 'lamp'. Introduced a reward chart to motivate Alex to practice these sounds at home.
**Session 4:** Progress Made: Alex showed improvement in producing /r/ sound but still struggles with /l/, especially when it's the first sound in a word. Encouraged continued practice of /l/ sound with parental support.
