### **Profile 1: Emily Thompson** (Generated by: qwen2.5:7b)
**Age:** 7 | **Grade:** 1st Grade | **Gender:** Female

#### Background
- **Medical History:** No known medical conditions affecting speech or hearing.
- **Parent Concerns:** Parents have noticed difficulty with certain sounds, particularly 's' and 'r'. They are concerned about the impact on Emily's social interactions and academic performance.
- **Teacher Concerns:** Teachers report that while Emily is a capable student in other areas, she often has trouble being understood by peers during group activities and class discussions. This sometimes leads to her feeling isolated or misunderstood.

#### Annual IEP Goals
1. To improve articulation of the /s/ sound to an age-appropriate standard.
2. To increase clarity in pronunciation of the /r/ sound, specifically 'r' at the beginning and end of words.

#### Latest 3 Session Notes
**Session 1:** Emily demonstrated difficulty with correctly producing the /s/ sound. She consistently substituted it with a 'sh' sound (e.g., saying 'shhake' instead of 'shake').
**Session 2:** Emily showed mixed success in pronouncing the /r/ sound, often omitting it entirely or substituting it with an 'er' sound (e.g., saying 'ber' for 'bear').
**Session 3:** During therapy sessions, Emily engaged well and demonstrated understanding of articulation concepts. She benefited from visual cues and verbal prompting.
