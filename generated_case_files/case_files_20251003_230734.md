### **Profile 1: Alex Johnson** (Generated by: qwen2.5:32b)
**Age:** 6 | **Grade:** 1st Grade | **Gender:** Male

#### Background
- **Medical History:** No significant medical history. No known allergies.
- **Parent Concerns:** Parents have noted that Alex often substitutes 'w' for 'r', making words like 'rabbit' sound like 'wabbit'. They are concerned about his articulation skills affecting his social interactions and academic performance.
- **Teacher Concerns:** Teacher reports that Alex's speech is sometimes difficult to understand, especially when he speaks quickly. This may affect classroom participation and peer interactions.

#### Annual IEP Goals
1. By the end of the school year, Alex will produce /r/ sounds in single words with 80% accuracy as measured by clinician data.
2. Alex will use correct /r/ sound in conversational speech with at least 75% accuracy across three consecutive sessions.

#### Latest 3 Session Notes
**Session 1:** Session Date: October 12, 2023
**Session 2:** Target Sounds: Initial /r/
**Session 3:** Activities Conducted: Alex practiced initial /r/ sounds in isolation and in single words. Used visual aids to demonstrate tongue positioning.
**Session 4:** Progress Notes: Alex made progress with the initial /r/ sound but still substituted 'w' for 'r' when speaking quickly.
**Session 5:** Parental Communication Plan: Sent a home practice sheet focusing on /r/ sounds and encouraged parents to engage in daily conversations emphasizing correct pronunciation of /r/.
