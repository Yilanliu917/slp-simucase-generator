### **Profile 1: Elliot Johnson** (Generated by: gpt-4o)
**Age:** 6 | **Grade:** 1st Grade | **Gender:** Male

#### Background
- **Medical History:** Elliot has a history of frequent ear infections, which were treated with antibiotics. He has had tubes placed in his ears twice, with the last procedure occurring at age 4. He has no known allergies and is up-to-date on vaccinations.
- **Parent Concerns:** Elliot's parents are concerned about his difficulty being understood by unfamiliar listeners due to his speech clarity. They also notice that he sometimes gets stuck on words, especially when he's excited or nervous.
- **Teacher Concerns:** Elliot's teacher reports that he struggles to participate in group discussions because he often repeats sounds or syllables. She has also noticed that other students sometimes have trouble understanding him when he talks quickly.

#### Annual IEP Goals
1. Elliot will improve articulation of /r/, /s/, and /l/ sounds in isolation and in words with 80% accuracy as measured by speech therapy data.
2. Elliot will demonstrate the ability to use a slow speech rate and light articulatory contact to reduce instances of stuttering in connected speech during structured activities with 70% accuracy.
3. Elliot will increase his intelligibility in spontaneous conversation to 80% as judged by unfamiliar listeners.

#### Latest 3 Session Notes
**Session 1:** Elliot participated in a 30-minute individual speech therapy session focusing on articulation of /s/ and /l/ sounds. He achieved 60% accuracy in producing /s/ in initial word positions and 50% for /l/ in final word positions.
**Session 2:** During fluency activities, Elliot practiced using a slow rate of speech and light articulatory contact. He successfully reduced stuttering to 3 instances in a 5-minute conversational task.
**Session 3:** Elliot showed enthusiasm during play-based activities but required frequent cues to slow down his speech and articulate clearly. He responded well to visual feedback and verbal praise.

### **Profile 2: Leo Martinez** (Generated by: gemini-2.5-pro)
**Age:** 6 | **Grade:** 1st Grade | **Gender:** Male

#### Background
- **Medical History:** No significant medical history. Passed newborn hearing screening. Parents report a history of seasonal allergies.
- **Parent Concerns:** Parents are concerned about their son's speech clarity, stating that 'he still sounds like a baby'. They also report that he 'gets stuck on his words' when he is excited or tired, and that this has been happening more often in the last few months. They are worried about him being teased at school.
- **Teacher Concerns:** The teacher reports that the student is sometimes difficult to understand, particularly in a noisy classroom. She has noticed he substitutes 'w' for /r/ sounds (e.g., 'wabbit' for 'rabbit'). She has also observed moments where he repeats the first sound of a word (e.g., 'b-b-but') when answering questions in class. She notes he is sometimes hesitant to share his ideas in a large group.

#### Annual IEP Goals
1. Leo will correctly produce the /r/ sound in the initial and medial positions of words with 80% accuracy during structured drills.
2. Leo will reduce the frequency of stuttering to below 5% of syllables in spontaneous conversation by using fluency shaping techniques (e.g., easy onset, light contacts).
3. Leo will demonstrate the ability to use stuttering modification strategies (e.g., pull-outs) when he experiences a moment of disfluency in 3 out of 5 opportunities.

#### Latest 3 Session Notes
**Session 1:** Session focused on the production of the initial /r/ sound using visual and tactile cues. Leo achieved 70% accuracy in word-level drills but this decreased to 40% in short sentences.
**Session 2:** Introduced the concept of 'bumpy' vs. 'smooth' speech. Leo was able to identify bumpy speech in the clinician's model with 90% accuracy. Practiced 'easy onsets' with vowel-initial words.
**Session 3:** Peer interaction was observed during a classroom push-in session. Leo demonstrated two instances of sound repetition and one block during a 5-minute group activity. He did not self-correct or use any strategies but was not perceived to be negatively impacted by the disfluencies by his peers in this observation.

### **Profile 3: Jayden Thompson** (Generated by: claude-3-opus)
**Age:** 6 | **Grade:** 1st Grade | **Gender:** Male

#### Background
- **Medical History:** Unremarkable birth and developmental history. No significant medical concerns.
- **Parent Concerns:** Parents report that Jayden has difficulty pronouncing certain sounds correctly, especially /r/ and /s/. They also note that he occasionally repeats syllables or gets stuck on words when excited.
- **Teacher Concerns:** Jayden's teacher mentions that his speech errors are impacting his confidence when participating in class. She has also observed mild stuttering behaviors that seem to increase when called on or anxious.

#### Annual IEP Goals
1. By the end of the IEP period, Jayden will produce /r/ and /s/ sounds in all positions of words with 90% accuracy in structured tasks.
2. Jayden will use fluency enhancing strategies to maintain fluent speech with fewer than 3% stuttered syllables in conversational speech.

#### Latest 3 Session Notes
**Session 1:** Session focused on /r/ production in initial and medial word positions using multisensory cues. Jayden produced /r/ with 80% accuracy in words. Introduced easy onset strategy for fluency.
**Session 2:** Jayden demonstrated /s/ in phrases with 85% accuracy. Practiced easy onset in short 2-3 word utterances, with reduced stuttering noted when strategy applied.
