### **Profile 1: Ethan Miller** (Generated by: gpt-4o)
**Age:** 6 | **Grade:** 1st Grade | **Gender:** Male

#### Background
- **Medical History:** Ethan was born full-term with no complications. He has had frequent ear infections in early childhood but no significant medical concerns currently.
- **Parent Concerns:** Ethan's parents are concerned about his speech clarity and the fact that he often stutters when excited or speaking in front of groups.
- **Teacher Concerns:** Ethan's teacher has noted that he struggles with certain sounds, such as 'r' and 's', and his stuttering can make it difficult for peers to understand him during class discussions.

#### Annual IEP Goals
1. Ethan will improve his articulation of the 'r' and 's' sounds in words with 80% accuracy during structured speech activities, as measured by speech-language pathologist observation and data collection.
2. Ethan will demonstrate a reduction in stuttering frequency and severity during classroom activities and conversations with familiar peers, achieving 70% fluency in structured settings, as recorded by teacher and therapist logs.
3. Ethan will increase his awareness and use of fluency strategies, such as slow speech and easy onset, to help manage instances of stuttering with 75% success in speech sessions.

#### Latest 3 Session Notes
**Session 1:** Ethan participated in a 30-minute individual session focused on articulation today. He practiced 'r' and 's' sounds in isolation and in words, achieving 60% accuracy.
**Session 2:** During a group session, Ethan was encouraged to use slow speech strategies. He was able to maintain fluency in 4 out of 6 attempts when speaking in front of peers.
**Session 3:** Ethan showed progress in self-monitoring his speech and was able to identify moments of stuttering in 3 out of 5 instances during the session.

### **Profile 2: Leo Chavez** (Generated by: gemini-2.5-pro)
**Age:** 6 | **Grade:** 1st Grade | **Gender:** Male

#### Background
- **Medical History:** No significant medical history. Passed newborn hearing screening. Parents report seasonal allergies.
- **Parent Concerns:** Parents are concerned about Leo's speech clarity, specifically mentioning his difficulty with the 'r' sound. They also report that he sometimes gets 'stuck' on his words, especially when he is excited or tired, and they have noticed him repeating sounds (e.g., 'c-c-can I go?').
- **Teacher Concerns:** The teacher reports that Leo is sometimes hesitant to read aloud or answer questions in class. She has noticed that other students have a hard time understanding him when he talks about his pet rabbit. She has also observed instances of sound repetitions at the beginning of his sentences.

#### Annual IEP Goals
1. Leo will correctly produce the /r/ sound in the initial, medial, and final positions of words with 80% accuracy during structured conversational tasks.
2. Leo will use fluency shaping strategies (e.g., easy onsets) to reduce the frequency of stuttering to below 3% of syllables in a 5-minute spontaneous speech sample.

#### Latest 3 Session Notes
**Session 1:** Session focused on auditory discrimination and production of the /r/ sound. Leo was able to identify correct vs. incorrect productions with 90% accuracy. We practiced initial /r/ in words using picture cards, achieving 60% accuracy with minimal verbal cues.
**Session 2:** Introduced the concept of 'bumpy' vs. 'smooth' speech. Leo identified bumpy speech in the clinician's models with 100% accuracy. We practiced using 'easy starts' on vowel-initial words in a structured game. Leo demonstrated emerging awareness of his own disfluencies.

### **Profile 3: Aiden Johnson** (Generated by: claude-3-opus)
**Age:** 6 | **Grade:** 1st Grade | **Gender:** Male

#### Background
- **Medical History:** Unremarkable birth and developmental history. No significant medical concerns.
- **Parent Concerns:** Parents report that Aiden's speech is often difficult to understand due to articulation errors. They also note that he has recently begun to stutter, especially when excited or anxious.
- **Teacher Concerns:** Teacher reports that Aiden has difficulty producing certain speech sounds correctly, impacting his intelligibility. She has also observed stuttering behaviors that are beginning to affect his confidence and participation in class.

#### Annual IEP Goals
1. By the end of the IEP period, Aiden will produce age-appropriate /r/ and /s/ sounds in all positions of words in conversation with 80% accuracy.
2. By the end of the IEP period, Aiden will use fluency enhancing techniques to speak with less than 5% stuttered syllables during oral reading and conversation.

#### Latest 3 Session Notes
**Session 1:** Aiden practiced /r/ and /s/ sounds in isolation and syllables using visual and tactile cues. He is currently producing the sounds with 60% accuracy in words.
**Session 2:** Introduced easy onset and phrasing techniques to reduce stuttering. Aiden demonstrated the strategies with moderate prompting in structured tasks.
