**Age:** 7 | **Grade:** 1st Grade | **Gender:** Male

#### Background
- **Medical History:** The student has a history of recurrent otitis media between the ages of 1 and 3, but has had no significant medical concerns since. Hearing is within normal limits.
- **Parent Concerns:** Parents report that family members and unfamiliar listeners have difficulty understanding the student, which causes him frustration. They are concerned that his speech difficulties are beginning to impact his social interactions and his willingness to speak at home.
- **Teacher Concerns:** The teacher notes that the student's speech is often unclear, especially during group activities or when he is excited. She has observed that he is sometimes hesitant to answer questions in class and that his speech sound errors may be impacting his ability to sound out words for reading and spelling tasks.

#### Annual IEP Goals
1. By the end of the IEP cycle, the student will correctly produce the /r/ sound in the initial, medial, and final positions of words with 80% accuracy across three consecutive sessions.
2. The student will improve overall speech intelligibility by correctly producing later-developing sounds (/l/, /sh/, /ch/) at the sentence level with 80% accuracy, as measured by SLP data collection.
3. The student will demonstrate improved phonological awareness skills by identifying and manipulating sounds in words (e.g., blending, segmenting CVC words) in 4 out of 5 trials to support pre-literacy skills.

#### Latest 3 Session Notes
**Session 1:** Session focused on auditory discrimination and production of the initial /r/ sound. The student was able to produce /r/ in isolation with a model but demonstrated difficulty at the word level. Used visual and tactile cues to elicit correct production. Accuracy at the word level was approximately 40% with maximal cueing.
**Session 2:** Targeted the /l/ sound in the initial position of words through a picture-naming task and drill-based games. The student achieved 75% accuracy with minimal verbal prompts. He showed good stimulability for the sound and was motivated by the activities.
**Session 3:** Introduced phonological awareness tasks focusing on segmenting CVC words. The student required moderate verbal and visual prompts to break words into their individual sounds. He was successful in 3 out of 10 trials. Will continue to build this foundational skill.
