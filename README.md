üéØ SLP SimuCase Generator
An AI-powered tool for Speech-Language Pathologists, students, and educators to generate realistic, simulated student case files for training and educational purposes. 

‚ú® Features

Customizable Scenarios: Specify grade levels, disorder types (e.g., Articulation, Language, Fluency), and the number of students to generate. 


Powered by Advanced AI: Choose from leading models like GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet to create diverse and nuanced profiles. 


Comprehensive Output: Each case includes a detailed student profile, background history, annual IEP goals, and sample session notes. 


RAG Architecture: Leverages a knowledge base of clinical documents to ensure generated content is realistic and context-aware. 


Cost Tracking: Includes built-in functionality to monitor and log estimated API costs for each generation. 

üöÄ Getting Started
Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Python 3.9+

Git

API keys for OpenAI, Google AI, and Anthropic

Installation
Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/slp-simucase-generator.git
cd slp-simucase-generator
Install dependencies:
It's recommended to use a virtual environment.

Bash

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up your environment variables:
Create a file named .env in the root of the project folder and add your API keys:

Code snippet

OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
GOOGLE_API_KEY="..."
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."
Build the Vector Database:
Place your clinical knowledge documents (.pdf, .docx) inside the data/slp_knowledge_base/ folder. Then, run the setup script to create the vector store:

Bash

python setup_kb.py
Usage
Once the installation is complete and the vector database is built, launch the Gradio application:

Bash

python app.py
Open your web browser and navigate to the local URL provided in the terminal (usually http://127.0.0.1:7860).

üìÇ Project Structure

app.py: The main Gradio application script that contains the UI and core generation logic. 

setup_kb.py: A script to process local documents and build the ChromaDB vector store.

requirements.txt: A list of all the Python libraries required for the project.


data/slp_knowledge_base/: The directory where you should place your source documents for the knowledge base.
